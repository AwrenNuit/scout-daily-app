# Scout Daily

## Description
Scout Daily is a mobile-first app created with big dreams of getting people outside exploring, honing creative skills, and having fun. The app gives all the users the same daily photography prompt (like "unique tree"). Users can upload their photos, view/like/comment other user's photos, and follow each other so their photos show up in the main feed.

## Technologies Used
- React
- React-Redux
- Redux-Saga
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Axios
- PostgreSQL
- JavaScript
- Material-UI
- CSS
- Heroku

## Installation
- Download or clone this repository
- 'npm install' from command line
- Set up your database, I recommend using Postico
- 'npm run server' starts the server
- 'npm run client' starts the client

## Future Plans
- Include language that prompts the user to create their own geo-hunt (user uploads photo, asks followers to find them and comment with photos when they do)
- Allow team creation for week-long contests: the team with the most votes gets some in-app badge/title/currency
- Create a SHARE button
